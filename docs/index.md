# Awesome Neural Network Reprogrammability

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for neural network reprogrammability resources.

## Overview

Neural network reprogrammability refers to methods that enable pre-trained neural networks to be adapted for new tasks with minimal parameter updates, leveraging existing learned representations.
